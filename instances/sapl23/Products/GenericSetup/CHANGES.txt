GenericSetup Product Changelog

  GenericSetup 1.2 (2007-04-24)

    - ZCatalog handler: Fixed 'remove' behavior.
      If the index doesn't exist, removing no longer raises an error.

    - utils: Fixed XMLAdapterBase.
      Exporting the XML body worked only once per instance.

    - No longer read the toolset xml and update the toolset registry on
      import context change.  Doing this only during the toolset step import
      should be sufficient.

  GenericSetup 1.2-beta (2006/09/20)

    - tool:  Added support for uploading a tarball on the "Import" tab
      (i.e., one produced on the export tab).

    - docs: Added SampleSite demo product.

    - ProfileRegistry: Added 'registerProfile' ZCML directive.
      Using the old registerProfile method in initialize() is now deprecated.
      See doc/profiles.txt for details.

    - ProfileRegistry: 'product' should now be the module name.
      For backwards compatibility 'product' is still first looked up in
      Products before searching the default module search path.

    - ZCTextIndex handler: Fixed 'indexed_attr' import.
      (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/436)

    - docs: Added 'Registering Profiles' section to profiles.txt.

    - Added support for PageTemplate import/export, modeled closely after
      existing PythonScript support

    - The dependency sorting was highly reliant on steps being added in the
      right order to work. If import step A depends on import step B which 
      depends on step C, and step C gets processed early, and they were 
      processed in the order A, C, B, then the dependency order would be 
      incorrect. This is now fixed by keeping tack of steps with unresolved
      dependencies, and trying again after inserting everything else.

  GenericSetup 1.1 (2006/04/16)

    - ZCatalog handler: Implemented the 'remove' directive for indexes.
      This allows to write extension profiles that remove or replace indexes.

    - getExportStepRegistry had the wrong security declaration

  GenericSetup 1.1-beta2 (2006/03/26)

    No changes - tag created to coincide with CMF 2.0.0-beta2

  GenericSetup 1.1-beta (2006/03/08)

    - Allowed subclasses of DAVAwareFileAdapter to override the filename
      in which the file is stored.

    - Added a doc directory including some basic documentation.

    - Made GenericSetup a standalone package independent of the CMF

    - Added 'for_' argument to profile registry operations.
      A profile may be registered and queried as appropriate to a specific
      site interface;  the default value, 'None', indicates that the profile
      is relevant to any site.  Note that this is essentially an adapter
      lookup;  perhaps we should reimplement it so.

    - Forward ported changes from GenericSetup 0.11 and 0.12 (which were
      created in a separate repository).

    - A sequence property with the purge="False" attribute will not be
      purged, but merged (the sequences are treated as sets, which means
      that duplicates are removed). This is useful in extension profiles.

    - Don't export or purge read-only properties. Correctly purge
      non-deletable int/float properties.

    - Correctly quote XML on export.

  GenericSetup 1.0 (2005/09/23)

    - CVS tag:  GenericSetup-1_0

    - Forward-ported i18n support from CMF 1.5 branch.

    - Forward ported BBB for old instances that stored properties as
      lists from CMFSetup.

    - Forward ported fix for tools with non unique IDs from CMFSetup.

  GenericSetup-0.12 (2005/08/29)

    - CVS tag:  GenericSetup-0_12

    - Import requests now create reports (by default) which record any
      status messages generated by the profile's steps.

  GenericSetup-0.11 (2005/08/23)

    - CVS tag:  GenericSetup-0_11

    - Added report of messages generated by import to the "Import" tab.

    - Consolidated ISetupContext implementation into base class,
      'SetupContextBase'.

    - Added 'note', 'listNotes', and 'clearNotes'  methods to ISetupContext,
      to allow plugins to record information about the state of the operation.

  GenericSetup 0.10 (2005/08/11)

    - CVS tag:  GenericSetup-0_10

    - Added TarballImportContext, including full test suite.
