This directory will hold any additional Python packages installed into
this Zope instance.  Installing Distutils-based packages should be
done using the command:

  /var/interlegis/SAPL-2.3/Python-2.4/bin/python2.4 setup.py install --home /var/interlegis/SAPL-2.3/instances/sapl23

This will cause the newly installed Python packages to appear in this
directory.
